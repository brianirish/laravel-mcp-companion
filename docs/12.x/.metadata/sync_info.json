  "commit_message": "[12.x] Add documentation about queued notification job properties (#10852)\n\n* Document queued notification job properties\n\nAdd documentation explaining that queued notifications inherit job-related properties (tries, timeout, maxExceptions, shouldBeEncrypted, backoff, retryUntil) from the notification class to the underlying queued job. This behavior is implemented in SendQueuedNotifications but was not previously documented.\n\n* Fix: Use ShouldBeEncrypted interface instead of property\n\nThe shouldBeEncrypted behavior is applied by implementing the ShouldBeEncrypted interface on the notification class, not by setting a property directly.\n\n* Remove menu item and adjust wording\n\n* Remove unnecessary sentence",
