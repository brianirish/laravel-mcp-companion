# The Basics

Learn how to define, register, and customize Nova resources.

## [​](#introduction) Introduction

Laravel Nova is a beautiful administration dashboard for Laravel applications. Of course, the primary feature of Nova is the ability to administer your underlying database records using Eloquent. Nova accomplishes this by allowing you to define a Nova “resource” that corresponds to each Eloquent model in your application.

## [​](#defining-resources) Defining Resources

By default, Nova resources are stored in the `app/Nova` directory of your application. You may generate a new resource using the `nova:resource` Artisan command:

Copy

Ask AI

```
php artisan nova:resource Post

```

The most basic and fundamental property of a resource is its `model` property. This property tells Nova which Eloquent model the resource corresponds to:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
namespace App\Nova;

class Post extends Resource
{
    /**
     * The model the resource corresponds to.
     *
     * @var class-string
     */
    public static $model = \App\Models\Post::class;
}

```

Freshly created Nova resources only contain an `ID` field definition. Don’t worry, we’ll add more fields to our resource soon.

Nova contains a few reserved words which may not be used for resource names:

- Card
- Dashboard
- Field
- Impersonate
- Metric
- Resource
- Search
- Script
- Style
- Tool

## [​](#registering-resources) Registering Resources

By default, all resources within the `app/Nova` directory will automatically be registered with Nova. You are not required to manually register them.

Before resources are available within your Nova dashboard, they must first be registered with Nova. Resources are typically registered in your application’s `app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php` file. This file contains various configuration and bootstrapping code related to your Nova installation.

**As mentioned above, you are not required to manually register your resources; however, if you choose to do so, you may do so by overriding the `resources` method of your `NovaServiceProvider`**.

There are two approaches to manually registering resources. You may use the `resourcesIn` method to instruct Nova to register all Nova resources within a given directory. Alternatively, you may use the `resources` method to manually register individual resources:

app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
use App\Nova\User;
use App\Nova\Post;

// ...

/**
 * Register the application's Nova resources.
 */
protected function resources(): void
{
    Nova::resourcesIn(app_path('Nova'));

    Nova::resources([
        User::class,
        Post::class,
    ]);
}

```

Once your resources are registered with Nova, they will be available in the Nova sidebar:

![Nova Dashboard](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nova-laravel/images/dashboard.png)

Dashboard

If you do not want a resource to appear in the sidebar, you may override the `displayInNavigation` property of your resource class:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
/**
 * Indicates if the resource should be displayed in the sidebar.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
public static $displayInNavigation = false;

```

#### [​](#customizing-resource-menus) Customizing Resource Menus

You can customize the resource’s menu by defining a `menu` method on your resource class:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

// ...

/**
 * Get the menu that should represent the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return \Laravel\Nova\Menu\MenuItem
 */
public function menu(Request $request)
{
    return parent::menu($request)->withBadge(function () {
        return static::$model::count();
    });
}

```

Please refer to the documentation on [menu customization](./../customization/menus) for more information.

## [​](#grouping-resources) Grouping Resources

If you would like to separate resources into different sidebar groups, you may override the `group` property of your resource class:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
/**
 * The logical group associated with the resource.
 *
 * @var string
 */
public static $group = 'Admin';

```

## [​](#resource-table-style-customization) Resource Table Style Customization

Nova supports a few visual customization options for your resources.

### [​](#table-styles) Table Styles

Sometimes it’s convenient to show more data on your resource index tables. To accomplish this, you can use the “tight” table style option designed to increase the visual density of your table rows. To accomplish this, override the static `$tableStyle` property or the static `tableStyle` method on your resource class:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
/**
 * The visual style used for the table. Available options are 'tight' and 'default'.
 *
 * @var string
 */
public static $tableStyle = 'tight';

```

This will display your table rows with less visual height, enabling more data to be shown:

![Tight Table Style](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nova-laravel/images/resource-tight-table.png)

Tight Table Style

### [​](#column-borders) Column Borders

You can instruct Nova to display column borders by overriding the static `$showColumnBorders` property or the static `showColumnBorders` method on your resource class:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
/**
 * Whether to show borders for each column on the X-axis.
 *
 * @var bool
 */
public static $showColumnBorders = true;

```

Setting this property to `true` will instruct Nova to display the table with borders on every table item:

![Table Column Borders](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/nova-laravel/images/resource-column-borders.png)

Table Column Borders

## [​](#resource-table-click-action) Resource Table Click Action

By default, when clicking on a resource table row, Nova will navigate to the detail view for the resource. However, you may want Nova to navigate to the edit form instead. You can customize this behavior by changing the `clickAction` property or the static `clickAction` method on your resource class:

Property

Method

Copy

Ask AI

```
/**
 * The click action to use when clicking on the resource in the table.
 *
 * Can be one of: 'detail' (default), 'edit', 'select', 'preview', or 'ignore'.
 *
 * @var string
 */
public static $clickAction = 'edit';

```

Choosing the `select` option will select the resource row’s checkbox. The `ignore` option instructs Nova to ignore click events altogether.

## [​](#eager-loading) Eager Loading

If you routinely need to access a resource’s relationships within your fields, [resource title](./../search/global-search#title-subtitle-attributes), or [resource subtitle](./../search/global-search#title-subtitle-attributes), it may be a good idea to add the relationship to the `with` property of your resource. This property instructs Nova to always eager load the listed relationships when retrieving the resource.

For example, if you access a `Post` resource’s `user` relationship within the `Post` resource’s `subtitle` method, you should add the `user` relationship to the `Post` resource’s `with` property:

app/Nova/Post.php

Copy

Ask AI

```
/**
 * The relationships that should be eager loaded on index queries.
 *
 * @var array
 */
public static $with = ['user'];

```
