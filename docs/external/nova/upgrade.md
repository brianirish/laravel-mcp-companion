Get Started# Upgrade Guide

Learn how to upgrade your Laravel Nova installation to the latest version.

## [​](#dependency-upgrades)Dependency Upgrades

Nova’s upstream dependencies have been upgraded. You will find a complete list of our dependency upgrades below:

#### [​](#server)Server

- PHP 8.1+

- Laravel Framework 10.34+ and 11.0+

- Inertia Laravel 1.3+ and 2.0+

- Replaced `laravel/ui` with `laravel/fortify` v1.21+

- Removed `doctrine/dbal`

#### [​](#client)Client

- Update to `@inertiajs/vue3` v2

- Update to Heroicons v2

- Update to `trix` v2

- Remove deprecated `form-backend-validation`

- Remove deprecated `places.js`

### [​](#updating-composer-dependencies)Updating Composer Dependencies

You should update your `laravel/nova` dependency to `^5.0` in your application’s `composer.json` file:

composer.jsonCopyAsk AI```
    "require": {
-       "laravel/nova": "^4.0",
+       "laravel/nova": "^5.0",
    }

```

Next, install your updated Composer dependencies:

CopyAsk AI```
composer update mirrors

composer update

```

### [​](#updating-assets-and-translations)Updating Assets and Translations

Next, you should update your application’s Nova assets and translation files. To get started, you may run the following commands to update your assets and translations.

**You may wish to store a copy of your current translation file before running this command so you can easily port any custom translations back into the new file after running these commands.**:

CopyAsk AI```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nova-assets --force
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nova-lang --force

```

### [​](#updating-third-party-nova-packages-%E2%80%8B)Updating Third-Party Nova Packages ​

If your application relies on Nova tools or packages developed by third-parties, it is possible that these packages are not yet compatible with Nova 5.0 and will require an update from their maintainers.

## [​](#upgrading-authentication-features)Upgrading Authentication Features

Next, you will need to update your Nova configuration file. Ensure that the `api_middleware` configuration option within your application’s `nova` configuration file appears as follows:

config/nova.phpCopyAsk AI```
return [

    // ...

    'api_middleware' => [
        'nova',
        \Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\Authenticate::class,
        // \Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\EnsureEmailIsVerified::class,
        \Laravel\Nova\Http\Middleware\Authorize::class,
    ],

];

```

Next, update the `register` method in your application’s `App\Providers\NovaServiceProvider` class to call the parent’s `register` method. The `parent::register()` method should be invoked before any other code in the method:

app/Nova/NovaServiceProvider.phpCopyAsk AI```
/**
 * Register any application services.
 */
public function register(): void 
{
    parent::register();

    //
}

```

## [​](#updating-nova-components-custom-tool%2C-cards%2C-fields%2C-filters)Updating Nova Components (Custom Tool, Cards, Fields, Filters)

### [​](#inertia-2-compatibility)Inertia 2 Compatibility

In Nova 5, Nova’s frontend JavaScript now utilizes Inertia.js 2.x, which will affect any projects that directly import from `@inertiajs/inertia` or `@inertiajs/inertia-vue3`. You should inspect your custom components and packages to ensure all references have been updated as suggested in [Inertia’s upgrade guide](https://inertiajs.com/upgrade-guide).

CopyAsk AI```
<script>
-import { usePage } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3'
-import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia'
+import { router as Inertia, usePage } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

// ...

</script>

```

### [​](#replacing-form-backend-validation)Replacing `form-backend-validation`

The `form-backend-validation` repository has been archived and should no longer be used by third-party packages or components. Instead, you may simply import `Errors` from `laravel-nova`:

CopyAsk AI```
<script>
-import { Errors } from 'form-backend-validation'
+import { Errors } from 'laravel-nova'

// ...

</script>

```

Then, you may remove `form-backend-validation` from your component’s `package.json`:

CopyAsk AI```
npm remove form-backend-validation

```

## [​](#medium-impact-changes)Medium Impact Changes

### [​](#form-abandonment-using-browser-navigation)Form Abandonment (Using Browser Navigation)

With the introduction of Inertia.js 2.x, we are no longer able to provide form abandonment warnings when using the browser’s back button.

### [​](#algolia-place-field-removed)Algolia Place Field Removed

Algolia [retired their “Places” API](https://www.algolia.com/blog/product/sunsetting-our-places-feature/) on May 31, 2022; therefore, the `Place` field was deprecated on Nova 4 and is now removed in Nova 5.

## [​](#low-impact-changes)Low Impact Changes

### [​](#update-published-stubs)Update Published Stubs

Due to various changes in Nova 5.x, you should re-publish the Nova “stubs” if you have previously published them. You can accomplish this by executing the `nova:stubs` Artisan command with the `--force` option:

CopyAsk AI```
php artisan nova:stubs --force

```
