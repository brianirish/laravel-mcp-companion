Digging Deeper# Resource Tools

Learn how to build custom tools for your Nova resources.

## [​](#overview)Overview

Resource tools are very similar to [custom tools](./tools); however, instead of being listed in the Nova sidebar, resource tools are displayed on a particular resource’s detail page. Like Nova tools, resource tools are incredibly customizable, and primarily consist of a single-file Vue component that is totally under your control.

## [​](#defining-tools)Defining Tools

Resource tools may be generated using the `nova:resource-tool` Artisan command. By default, all new tools will be placed in the `nova-components` directory of your application. When generating a tool using the `nova:resource-tool` command, the tool name you pass to the command should follow the Composer `vendor/package` format. So, if we were building a Stripe inspector tool, we might run the following command:

CopyAsk AI```
php artisan nova:resource-tool acme/stripe-inspector

```

When generating a tool, Nova will prompt you to install the tool’s NPM dependencies, compile its assets, and update your application’s `composer.json` file. All custom tools are registered with your application as a Composer [“path” repository](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories#path).

Nova resource tools include all of the scaffolding necessary to build your tool. Each tool even contains its own `composer.json` file and is ready to be shared with the world on GitHub or the source control provider of your choice.

## [​](#registering-tools)Registering Tools

Nova resource tools may be registered in your resource’s `fields` method. This method returns an array of fields and tools available to the resource. To register your resource tool, add your tool to the array of fields returned by this method:

app/Nova/~Resource.phpCopyAsk AI```
use Acme\StripeInspector\StripeInspector;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;

// ...

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return array<int, \Laravel\Nova\Fields\Field|\Laravel\Nova\ResourceTool>
 */
public function fields(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        ID::make()->sortable(),

        StripeInspector::make(),
    ];
}

```

### [​](#authorization)Authorization

If you would like to only expose a given tool to certain users, you may invoke the `canSee` method when registering your tool. The `canSee` method accepts a closure which should return `true` or `false`. The closure will receive the incoming HTTP request:

app/Nova/~Resource.phpCopyAsk AI```
use Acme\StripeInspector\StripeInspector;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;

// ...

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return array<int, \Laravel\Nova\Fields\Field|\Laravel\Nova\ResourceTool>
 */
public function fields(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        ID::make('ID', 'id')->sortable(),

        StripeInspector::make()->canSee(function ($request) {
            return $request->user()->managesBilling();
        }),
    ];
}

```

### [​](#tool-options)Tool Options

Often, you will need to allow the consumer’s of your tool to customize run-time configuration options on the tool. You may do this by exposing methods on your tool class. These methods may call the tool’s underlying `withMeta` method to add information to the tool’s metadata, which will be available within your `Tool.vue` component. The `withMeta` method accepts an array of key / value options:

nova-components/StripeInspector/src/StripeInspector.phpCopyAsk AI```
namespace Acme\StripeInspector;

use Laravel\Nova\ResourceTool;

class StripeInspector extends ResourceTool
{
    // ...

    /**
     * Indicates that the Stripe inspector should allow refunds.
     *
     * @return $this
     */
    public function issuesRefunds()
    {
        return $this->withMeta(['issuesRefunds' => true]);
    }
}

```

#### [​](#accessing-tool-options)Accessing Tool Options

Your resource tool’s `Tool.vue` component receives several Vue `props`: `resourceName`, `resourceId`, and `panel`. The `resourceId` property contains the primary key of the resource the tool is currently attached to. You may use the `resourceId` when making requests to your controllers. The `panel` prop provides access to any tool options that may be available via the `fields`:

CopyAsk AI```
const issuesRefunds = this.panel.fields[0].issuesRefunds;

```

#### [​](#dynamic-options)Dynamic Options

Resource tools also offer the ability to dynamically set options on the tool without a setter method by simple calling the desired option as a method when registering the tool. If called with an argument, it will be set as the option’s value:

CopyAsk AI```
use Acme\StripeInspector\StripeInspector;
use Laravel\Nova\Http\Requests\NovaRequest;

// ...

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return array<int, \Laravel\Nova\Fields\Field|\Laravel\Nova\ResourceTool>
 */
public function fields(NovaRequest $request): array
{
    return [
        ID::make('ID', 'id')->sortable(),

        StripeInspector::make()->issuesRefunds(),
    ];
}

```

## [​](#building-tools)Building Tools

Each tool generated by Nova includes its own service provider and “tool” class. Using the `stripe-inspector` tool as an example, the tool class will be located at `src/StripeInspector.php`.

The tool’s service provider is also located within the `src` directory of the tool, and is registered within the `extra` section of your tool’s `composer.json` file so that it will be auto-loaded by Laravel.

### [​](#routing)Routing

Often, you will need to define Laravel routes that are called by your tool. When Nova generates your tool, it creates a `routes/api.php` routes file. If needed, you may use this file to define any routes your tool requires.

All routes within this file are automatically defined inside a route group by your tool’s `ToolServiceProvider`. The route group specifies that all routes within the group should receive a `/nova-vendor/tool-name` prefix, where `tool-name` is the “kebab-case” name of your tool. So, for example, `/nova-vendor/stripe-inspector`. You are free to modify this route group definition, but take care to make sure your Nova tool will co-exist with other Nova packages.

When building routes for your tool, you should **always** add authorization to these routes using Laravel gates or policies.

## [​](#assets)Assets

When Nova generates your tool, `resources/js` and `resources/css` directories are generated for you. These directories contain your tool’s JavaScript and CSS. The primary files of interest in these directories are: `resources/js/components/Tool.vue` and `resources/css/tool.css`.

The `Tool.vue` file is a single-file Vue component that contains your tool’s front-end. From this file, you are free to build your tool however you want. Your tool can make HTTP requests using Axios via [Nova.request](./frontend#nova-requests).

### [​](#registering-assets)Registering Assets

Your Nova tool’s service provider registers your tool’s compiled assets so that they will be available to the Nova front-end:

nova-components/StripeInspector/src/ToolServiceProvider.phpCopyAsk AI```
use Laravel\Nova\Nova;
use Laravel\Nova\Events\ServingNova;

// ...

/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    parent::boot();

    $this->app->booted(function () {
        $this->routes();
    });

    Nova::serving(function (ServingNova $event) {
        Nova::mix('strip
