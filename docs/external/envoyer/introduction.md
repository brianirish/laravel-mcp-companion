## [​](#envoyer-ip-addresses) Envoyer IP Addresses
If you are restricting SSH access to your server using IP whitelisting, you **must** whitelist the following IP addresses:
- `159.65.47.205`
- `157.245.120.132`
- `134.122.14.47`
- `144.126.248.121`
You may also need to whitelist the [Health Check IP addresses](/projects/management#health-check-ip-addresses).
## [​](#envoyer-api) Envoyer API
Envoyer provides a powerful API that allows you to manage your servers programmatically, providing access to the vast majority of Envoyer features. You can find the Envoyer API documentation [here](https://envoyer.io/api-documentation).
## [​](#limitations) Limitations
Envoyer is not necessary for applications running [Laravel Octane](https://github.com/laravel/octane), as Octane already includes zero-downtime deployments out of the box.
