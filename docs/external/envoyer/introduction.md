![Laravel Forge x Envoyer](https://mintcdn.com/envoyer/t2bz6kuyoDJvJvYR/images/forge-envoyer-integration-header.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=t2bz6kuyoDJvJvYR&q=85&s=dbd13839cb1d1075169a79bfef643bf6)

## [​](#envoyer-ip-addresses) Envoyer IP Addresses

If you are restricting SSH access to your server using IP whitelisting, you **must** whitelist the following IP addresses:

- `159.65.47.205`
- `157.245.120.132`
- `134.122.14.47`
- `144.126.248.121`

You may also need to whitelist the [Health Check IP addresses](/projects/management#health-check-ip-addresses).

## [​](#envoyer-api) Envoyer API

Envoyer provides a powerful API that allows you to manage your servers programmatically, providing access to the vast majority of Envoyer features. You can find the Envoyer API documentation [here](https://envoyer.io/api-documentation).

## [​](#limitations) Limitations

Envoyer is not necessary for applications running [Laravel Octane](https://github.com/laravel/octane), as Octane already includes zero-downtime deployments out of the box.

## [​](#legal-and-compliance) Legal and Compliance

Our [Terms of Service](https://envoyer.io/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://envoyer.io/privacy) provide details on the terms, conditions, and privacy practices for using Envoyer.
