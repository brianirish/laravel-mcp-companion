How to manage your Envoyer projects.

​

To create new projects, you must be subscribed to one of Envoyer’s paid subscriptions.

The configured URL must return a `2xx` status code. All other status codes will be considered a failure.

Deleting your project is an irreversible action, and we will be unable to recover the project’s settings for you.
