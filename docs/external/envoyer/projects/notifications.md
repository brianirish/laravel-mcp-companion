# Notifications
Receive notifications from Envoyer.
## [​](#overview) Overview
Envoyer can optionally notify you after a deployment completes and inform you whether it’s deployed successfully or not. Configured notification channels will also be used by Envoyer’s Heartbeat and health check services.
## [​](#channels) Channels
Envoyer supports a variety of notification channels, and you are welcome to configure multiple channels for your project:
- Slack
- Email
- Discord
- Microsoft Teams
After you have selected a channel, you will be asked to provide a name for the channel, webhook URL, or email address. Once you’ve finished providing this information, click **Add Channel** to confirm.
