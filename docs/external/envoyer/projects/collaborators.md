# Envoyer - Projects/Collaborators

*Source: https://docs.envoyer.io/projects/collaborators*

---

Manage who can collaborate on your projects.

â€‹

In addition, you can invite collaborators to your project who do not have a paid Envoyer subscription plan. This means that your company or team only need one active subscription to Envoyer.

Only project owners are able to manage project collaborators.
