## [​](#introduction) Introduction

Teams allow you to further manage members of an organization by only granting them access to certain servers or resources within that organization. You can create as many teams as you would like and add as many team members as needed to each team.

## [​](#managing-teams) Managing teams

### [​](#creating-teams) Creating teams

To create a team, navigate to the organization’s dashboard and click “Teams”. Then, click the “New team” button. After providing a name, click “Create”.

### [​](#editing-teams) Editing teams

To edit a team, navigate to the team’s dashboard. Then, on the “Teams” page, click on the team that you wish to edit. Navigate to the “Settings” tab to change the name, avatar or delete the team.

### [​](#deleting-teams) Deleting teams

To delete a team, navigate to the team’s dashboard. Then, on the “Teams” page, click on the team that you wish to edit. Navigate to the “Settings” tab and click “Delete team”. Confirm the team’s name and press “Confirm”.

When deleting a team, members will no longer be able to access any shared resources.

## [​](#organization-members) Organization members

As an owner or admin of an organization on the Business plan, you are able to create and manage teams.

### [​](#managing-team-members) Managing team members

To invite a new member to the team, you need to provide their email address and at least one permission. If the email address provided doesn’t match an existing Laravel Forge account, the user will be invited to create an account. The invited user may accept the invite from the same email.

### [​](#inviting-new-members) Inviting new members

To invite someone to an organization, navigate to the organization’s dashboard and click “Settings” > “Members”. Then, enter the email of the new user, select their role, and click “Send invite”. The invited user will receive an email and notification that will allow them to accept the invitation to join the organization.

## [​](#team-members) Team members

### [​](#joining-teams) Joining teams

After being invited to a team, you will receive an email with a link that you may use to accept an invitation. A notification will also be visible in the notification center.

### [​](#leaving-teams) Leaving teams

You can leave a team that you are a member of by visiting the team dashboard and clicking the “Leave” button next to the team’s name.
