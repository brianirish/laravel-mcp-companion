# Key-value

> Filament 5.x documentation
> Source: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/key-value.md

## Introduction

The key-value field allows you to interact with one-dimensional JSON object:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
```



If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an ` array ` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'meta' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Adding rows

An action button is displayed below the field to allow the user to add a new row.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a row, using the ` addActionLabel() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->addActionLabel('Add property')
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` addActionLabel() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

## Customizing the key-value action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the ` $action ` object, which you can use to [customize it](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/actions/overview.md). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- ` addAction() `
- ` deleteAction() `
- ` reorderAction() `

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->icon(Heroicon::XMark),
    )
```

The action registration methods can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.
