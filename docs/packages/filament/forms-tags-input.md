# Tags input

> Filament 5.x documentation
> Source: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/tags-input.md

## Introduction

The tags input component allows you to interact with a list of tags.

By default, tags are stored in JSON:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
```



If you're saving the JSON tags using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an ` array ` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'tags' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Filament also supports [` spatie/laravel-tags `](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-tags). See our [plugin documentation](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/filament-spatie-tags) for more information.

## Comma-separated tags

You may allow the tags to be stored in a separated string, instead of JSON. To set this up, pass the separating character to the ` separator() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->separator(',')
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` separator() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

## Autocompleting tag suggestions

Tags inputs may have autocomplete suggestions. To enable this, pass an array of suggestions to the ` suggestions() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->suggestions([
        'tailwindcss',
        'alpinejs',
        'laravel',
        'livewire',
    ])
```

As well as allowing a static array, the ` suggestions() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |

| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Defining split keys

Split keys allow you to map specific buttons on your user's keyboard to create a new tag. By default, when the user presses "Enter", a new tag is created in the input. You may also define other keys to create new tags, such as "Tab" or " ". To do this, pass an array of keys to the ` splitKeys() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->splitKeys(['Tab', ' '])
```

You can [read more about possible options for keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).

As well as allowing a static array, the ` splitKeys() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |

| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Adding a prefix and suffix to individual tags

You can add prefix and suffix to tags without modifying the real state of the field. This can be useful if you need to show presentational formatting to users without saving it. This is done with the ` tagPrefix() ` or ` tagSuffix() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('percentages')
    ->tagSuffix('%')
```



As well as allowing static values, the ` tagPrefix() ` and ` tagSuffix() ` methods also accept functions to dynamically calculate them. You can inject various utilities into the functions as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |

| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Reordering tags

You can allow the user to reorder tags within the field using the ` reorderable() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->reorderable()
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the tags should be reorderable or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->reorderable(FeatureFlag::active())
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` reorderable() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

## Changing the color of tags

You can change the color of the tags by passing a [color](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/styling/colors.md) to the ` color() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->color('danger')
```



As well as allowing a static value, the ` color() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Trimming whitespace

You can automatically trim whitespace from the beginning and end of each tag using the ` trim() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->trim()
```

You may want to enable trimming globally for all tags inputs, similar to Laravel's ` TrimStrings ` middleware. You can do this in a service provider using the ` configureUsing() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::configureUsing(function (TagsInput $component): void {
    $component->trim();
});
```

## Tags validation

You may add validation rules for each tag by passing an array of rules to the ` nestedRecursiveRules() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->nestedRecursiveRules([
        'min:3',
        'max:255',
    ])
```
