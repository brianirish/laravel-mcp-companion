# Key-value entry

> Filament 5.x documentation
> Source: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/infolists/key-value-entry.md

## Introduction

The key-value entry allows you to render key-value pairs of data, from a one-dimensional JSON object / PHP array.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
```

For example, the state of this entry might be represented as:

```php
[
    'description' => 'Filament is a collection of Laravel packages',
    'og:type' => 'website',
    'og:site_name' => 'Filament',
]
```



If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an ` array ` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'meta' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Customizing the key column's label

You may customize the label for the key column using the ` keyLabel() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->keyLabel('Property name')
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` keyLabel() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entry | ` Filament\Infolists\Components\Entry ` | ` $component ` | The current entry component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current schema data. Validation is not run on form fields. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the entry. |


## Customizing the value column's label

You may customize the label for the value column using the ` valueLabel() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->valueLabel('Property value')
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` valueLabel() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the entry. |
