## Introduction

Filament includes an action that is able to view Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with information inside. Filament uses form fields to structure this information. All form fields are disabled, so they are not editable by the user. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

ViewAction::make()
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```



## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the ` mutateRecordDataUsing() ` method to modify the ` $data ` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;

ViewAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

As well as ` $data `, the ` mutateRecordDataUsing() ` function can inject various utilities as parameters.

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Action | ` Filament\Actions\Action ` | ` $action ` | The current action instance. |
| Arguments | ` array<string, mixed> ` | ` $arguments ` | The array of arguments passed to the action when it was triggered. |
| Data | ` array<string, mixed> ` | ` $data ` | The array of data submitted from form fields in the action's modal. It will be empty before the modal form is submitted. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current action, if one is attached. |
| Mounted actions | ` array<Filament\Actions\Action> ` | ` $mountedActions ` | The array of actions that are currently mounted in the Livewire component. This is useful for accessing data from parent actions. |
| Parent action | ` ?Filament\Actions\Action ` | ` $parentAction ` | The mounted parent action, or the containing parent action if one exists. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current action, if one is attached. |
| Schema | ` Filament\Schemas\Schema ` | ` $schema ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] The schema object that this action belongs to. |
| Schema component | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Component ` | ` $schemaComponent ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] The schema component that this action belongs to. |
| Schema component state | ` mixed ` | ` $schemaComponentState ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] The current value of the schema component. |
| Schema get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $schemaGet ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] A function for retrieving values from the schema data. Validation is not run on form fields. |
| Schema operation | ` string ` | ` $schemaOperation ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Schema set function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Set ` | ` $schemaSet ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] A function for setting values in the schema data. |
| Schema state | ` mixed ` | ` $schemaState ` | \[Actions in schemas only\] The current value of the schema that this action belongs to, like the current repeater item. |
| Selected Eloquent records | ` Illuminate\Support\Collection\|Illuminate\Support\LazyCollection ` | ` $selectedRecords ` | \[Actions in tables only\] The selected records, filtered by individual record authorization when it is enabled. Requires ` accessSelectedRecords() `. |
| Selected Eloquent records query | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder ` | ` $selectedRecordsQuery ` | \[Actions in Eloquent-query-backed tables only\] The query for the selected records. Requires ` accessSelectedRecords() `. Individual record authorization has not been applied to this query. |
| Table | ` Filament\Tables\Table ` | ` $table ` | \[Actions in tables only\] The table object that this action belongs to. |
