# Toggle buttons

> Filament 5.x documentation
> Source: https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/toggle-buttons.md

## Introduction

The toggle buttons input provides a group of buttons for selecting a single value, or multiple values, from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
```

As well as allowing a static array, the ` options() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |




By default, the field stores one selected option. Selecting that option again clears the field to ` null `.

With ` required() `, a single-select field uses radio buttons styled as buttons. The field can start empty, but once you select an option, you can only replace it with another option, not clear it by selecting it again. You can navigate between options using the arrow keys.

Use [` multiple() `](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/toggle-buttons.md#selecting-multiple-buttons) to store more than one option. In multiple-select fields, ` required() ` prevents submitting an empty value but still allows you to deselect every option while editing.

## Changing the color of option buttons

You can change the [color](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/styling/colors.md) of the option buttons using the ` colors() ` method. Each key in the array should correspond to an option value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->colors([
        'draft' => 'info',
        'scheduled' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
    ])
```

If you are using an enum for the options, you can use the [` HasColor ` interface](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/advanced/enums.md#enum-colors) to define colors instead.

As well as allowing a static array, the ` colors() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |




## Adding icons to option buttons

You can add [icon](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/styling/icons.md) to the option buttons using the ` icons() ` method. Each key in the array should correspond to an option value, and the value may be any valid [icon](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/styling/icons.md):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;
use Filament\Support\Icons\Heroicon;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->icons([
        'draft' => Heroicon::OutlinedPencil,
        'scheduled' => Heroicon::OutlinedClock,
        'published' => Heroicon::OutlinedCheckCircle,
    ])
```

As well as allowing a static array, the ` icons() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |

| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


If you are using an enum for the options, you can use the [` HasIcon ` interface](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/advanced/enums.md#enum-icons) to define icons instead.



If you want to display only icons, you can use ` hiddenButtonLabels() ` to hide the option labels.



## Adding tooltips to option buttons

You can add different tooltips to each option button using the ` tooltips() ` method.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->tooltips([
        'draft' => 'Set as a draft before publishing.',
        'scheduled' => 'Schedule publishing on a specific date.',
        'published' => 'Publish now',
    ])
```

As well as allowing a static array, the ` tooltips() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |




## Changing the button size

By default, toggle buttons use the medium size. You can change the size using the ` size() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Size;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->size(Size::Small)
```

The available sizes are ` Size::ExtraSmall `, ` Size::Small `, ` Size::Medium `, ` Size::Large `, and ` Size::ExtraLarge `. You can also pass their backed values (` 'xs' `, ` 'sm' `, ` 'md' `, ` 'lg' `, and ` 'xl' `). Any other string is applied as a custom CSS class. Passing ` null ` restores the default medium size. The button size is also applied when using ` grouped() `.

As well as allowing a static value, the ` size() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |

| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |




## Boolean options

If you want a simple boolean toggle button group, with "Yes" and "No" options, you can use the ` boolean() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
```

The options will have [colors](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/toggle-buttons.md#changing-the-color-of-option-buttons) and [icons](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/toggle-buttons.md#adding-icons-to-option-buttons) set up automatically, but you can override these with ` colors() ` or ` icons() `.



To customize the "Yes" label, you can use the ` trueLabel ` argument on the ` boolean() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(trueLabel: 'Absolutely!')
```

To customize the "No" label, you can use the ` falseLabel ` argument on the ` boolean() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean(falseLabel: 'Not at all!')
```

## Positioning the options inline with each other

You may wish to display the buttons ` inline() ` with each other:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
```



Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should be inline or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline(FeatureFlag::active())
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` inline() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Grouping option buttons

You may wish to group option buttons together so they are more compact, using the ` grouped() ` method. This also makes them appear horizontally inline with each other:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->grouped()
```



Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should be grouped or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->grouped(FeatureFlag::active())
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` grouped() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |

| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Filling the container's width

By default, the buttons only take up as much horizontal space as they need. You may use the ` fullWidth() ` method to allow buttons to stretch and fill the available width of their container. This can be used with the default (stacked) configuration, or alongside both ` inline() ` and ` grouped() ` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
    ->fullWidth()
```



Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should fill the container width or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
    ->fullWidth(FeatureFlag::active())
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` fullWidth() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |

| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Selecting multiple buttons

The ` multiple() ` method on the ` ToggleButtons ` component allows you to select multiple values from the list of options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```



These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an ` array ` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    /**
     * @return array<string, string>
     */
    protected function casts(): array
    { 
        return [
            'technologies' => 'array',
        ];
    }

    // ...
}
```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the buttons should allow multiple selections or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->multiple(FeatureFlag::active())
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` multiple() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |

| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |
| Operation | ` string ` | ` $operation ` | The current operation being performed by the schema. Usually ` create `, ` edit `, or ` view `. |
| Parent repeater item index | ` int ` | ` $parentRepeaterItemIndex ` | The zero-based index of the nearest containing repeater item or builder block, or ` 0 ` when neither exists. |
| Raw state | ` mixed ` | ` $rawState ` | The current value of the field, before state casts were applied. Validation is not run. |
| Record | ` Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model\|array<string, mixed>\|null ` | ` $record ` | The Eloquent record or custom data array for the current schema. |
| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |


## Splitting options into columns

You may split options into columns by using the ` columns() ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` columns() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

[Utility injection guide](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/overview.md#field-utility-injection)

| Utility | Type | Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Field | ` Filament\Forms\Components\Field ` | ` $component ` | The current field component instance. |
| Get function | ` Filament\Schemas\Components\Utilities\Get ` | ` $get ` | A function for retrieving values from the current form data. Validation is not run. |
| Livewire | ` Livewire\Component ` | ` $livewire ` | The Livewire component instance. |
| Eloquent model FQN | ` ?string<Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model> ` | ` $model ` | The Eloquent model FQN for the current schema. |

| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |




This method accepts the same options as the ` columns() ` method of the [grid](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/schemas/layouts.md#grid-system). This allows you to responsively customize the number of columns at various breakpoints.

### Setting the grid direction

By default, when you arrange buttons into columns, they will be listed in order vertically. If you'd like to list them horizontally, you may use the ` gridDirection(GridDirection::Row) ` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;
use Filament\Support\Enums\GridDirection;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->gridDirection(GridDirection::Row)
```

As well as allowing a static value, the ` gridDirection() ` method also accepts a function to dynamically calculate it. You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

| State | ` mixed ` | ` $state ` | The current value of the field. Validation is not run. |




## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the ` disableOptionWhen() ` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific ` $value ` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

You can inject various utilities into the function as parameters.

| Option value | ` mixed ` | ` $value ` | The value of the option to disable. |




If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using ` getEnabledOptions() `:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
    ->in(fn (ToggleButtons $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

For more information about the ` in() ` function, please see the [Validation documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/5.x/forms/validation.md#in).
