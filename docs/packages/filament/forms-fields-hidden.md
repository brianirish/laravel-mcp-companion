# Filament - Forms/Fields/Hidden

Source: https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/forms/fields/hidden

#Overview
---------

The hidden component allows you to create a hidden field in your form that holds a value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Hidden;

Hidden::make('token')

```
Please be aware that the value of this field is still editable by the user if they decide to use the browserâ€™s developer tools. You should not use this component to store sensitive or read-only information.
